# OpenShift Client - oc

With OpenShift Client CLI (oc), you can create applications and manage OpenShift
resources.  It is built on top of [kubectl](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubectl/)
which means it provides its full capabilities to connect with any kubernetes
compliant cluster, and on top adds commands simplifying interaction with an
OpenShift cluster.


# Contributing

All contributions are welcome - oc uses the Apache 2 license and does not require
any contributor agreement to submit patches.  Please open issues for any bugs
or problems you encounter, ask questions on the OpenShift IRC channel
(#openshift-dev on Libera Chat), or get involved in the [kubectl](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubectl)
and [kubernetes project](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) at the container
runtime layer.

## Building

To build oc invoke `make oc`. At any time you can invoke `make help` and you'll
get a list of all supported make sub-commands.

In order to build `oc`, you will need the GSSAPI sources. On a Fedora/CentOS/RHEL
workstation, install them with:

```
dnf install krb5-devel
```

Also:

```
dnf install gpgme-devel
dnf install libassuan-devel
```

For MacOS you'll need to install a few brew packages before building locally. Install them with:
```
brew install heimdal
brew install gpgme
```
## Testing

All PRs will have to pass a series of automated tests starting from go tools
such as `go fmt` and `go vet`, through unit tests, up to e2e against a real cluster.

Locally you can invoke the initial verification and unit test through `make verify`
and `make test`, accordingly.

## Dependencies

Dependencies are managed through [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules).
When updating any dependency the suggested workflow is:

1. `go mod tidy`
2. `go mod vendor`
