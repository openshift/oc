Message: An unintended reversion to the default kubelet nodeStatusReportFrequency can cause significant load on the control plane. https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MCO-1094
  
  After rebooting into kernel-4.18.0-372.88.1.el8_6 or later, kernel nodes experience high load average and io_wait times. The nodes might fail to start or stop pods and probes may fail. Workload and host processes may become unresponsive and workload may be disrupted. https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COS-2705
